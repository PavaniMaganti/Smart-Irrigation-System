# AI-Based IoT Smart Irrigation System

This project uses **AI** to predict the optimal irrigation schedule for plants based on environmental data (such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, etc.). The model helps automate irrigation by predicting the water requirements for plants.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- AI model for predicting irrigation needs
- Model evaluation using accuracy and precision

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Smart Irrigation Systems in Agriculture.csv, and it contains environmental data (moisture, temperature, humidity) that was gathered from IoT sensors. You can download the dataset from this repository and use it for training the model.
## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- Algorithms: Random Forest, neural network, SVM, KNN etc.

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy**: 99%
- **Best-performing model**: KNN and Neural network

-**Accuracy**: 100%
- **Best-performing model**: Decision tree and Random forest
